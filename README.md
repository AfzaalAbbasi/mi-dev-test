# MI developer test.

Massive Infinity is hiring a new developer.

In order to test your capacities, we want you to spend a some time on this simple project.
The purpose of this project is really simple, you need to create a showcase application that download and parse AT THE SAME TIME the history of the versions of Android and some device informations. Create a database and store the data is a plus. Once the download is finish, you need to display on the main screen both informations in a listview. 

You can click on the device and have the related android version information (name, version code).

You also need to have a plus button to add a new info directly from the application. The server is a basic restFull server. Witch means you can easily POST new info. 

## How to GET and POST the data ?
We deployed on our side the "JSON Server" from Typicode [<a href='https://github.com/typicode/json-server'>Github</a>]
The server is up here : <a href='http://mobilesandboxdev.azurewebsites.net/'>http://mobilesandboxdev.azurewebsites.net/</a>. There is no landing page.
You can see the database here  <a href='http://mobilesandboxdev.azurewebsites.net/db'>http://mobilesandboxdev.azurewebsites.net/db</a>
Check the Json Server documentation to see how to get the related informations.

The application need to be easily extensible. 
We are more focusing on the way you code and how you will solve this problem than the design of the app. 

## We want to know if you can 
- Create an extensible app
- Use a RestFul server (GET / POST). Create the PUT and DELETE will be a plus.
- Multithreading is a plus
- Use GIT
- Intuitive UI.

## How to submit ?
You should fork this repository. This exercise should take no longer than 2 days. However, you are not timed and you can send us a pull request whenever you finish. (If you have something live going on, even better!)
